# Tenzie Game

Tenzie is a fun and fast-paced dice game where the objective is to roll ten dice and get all of them to show the same number as quickly as possible. It's a game of chance, strategy, and quick thinking.

## How to Play

1. **Setup**:
   - You have ten dice to start with.
   - At the beginning of the game, all dice are rolled to generate a random initial state.

2. **Objective**:
   - The goal is to get all ten dice to display the same number.

3. **Gameplay**:
   - Roll all ten dice.
   - Choose a number you want all dice to show.
   - Keep the dice that show the chosen number and roll the rest.
   - Continue rolling the remaining dice until all ten dice show the chosen number.

4. **Winning the Game**:
   - The game is won when all ten dice show the same number.
   - The challenge is to achieve this as quickly as possible.

## Features

- **Interactive UI**: The game interface allows players to click on dice to hold them and roll the rest.
- **Timer**: Keep track of how long it takes to achieve the goal.
- **Best Count and Time**: Save your best roll count and best time to local storage to keep track of your personal records.
- **Reset Button**: Quickly reset the game to start a new round.
- **Responsive Design**: Play the game on any device, from desktops to mobile phones.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React for a more dynamic interface).
- **Styling**: CSS for custom styles, potentially with a preprocessor like Sass for better modularity.
- **State Management**: React hooks or state management libraries to handle the game state.
- **Local Storage**: Used to save the best count and best time.

## How to Run the Game

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tenzie-game.git
   cd tenzie-game


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
